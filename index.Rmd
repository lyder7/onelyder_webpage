## Bio

From my Studies in Finance, my key professional strength, and niche-competence, are combing Data Sience and Finance together. I personally recognized this relationship having Data Science classes in my final semester. And I love it.

Real Estate, and Optimal Portfolios are my Financial themes of choice. These are of huge professional interest. I am exited about learning more about these subjects from an audit perspective.
Code Languages I use daily: R and Python.

(Btw I like Chess, hmu if you also like to play chess.)

As a results of coding and analyzing real-estate related problems with virus data,Dynamic and Reproducible Report Documenting are a part of my #toolbox. Text formatting languages such as Markdown, Latex or HTML are example of tools i have used.
