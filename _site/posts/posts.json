References will be somewhat related to R, but mainly will these links be brought about academic writing, workflow and project management. It also const of Github users, thereabout frameworks and rich content regarding modelling, time series, data and analysis.\n\nmiltonfmr (quant-site)\nhttps://miltonfmr.com/complete-list-of-libraries-packages-and-resources-for-quants/\n\nTime-series\nhttp://www.time-series.net/\nFound this when I serched for material regarding VAR. Think I first found this link:http://www.fsb.miamioh.edu/lij14/ and this time-series via that. It should be a lot of example and framework relatied things regarding R-code, finance, but also academic list and material…\nCode https://sites.google.com/view/davidgabauer/econometric-code\nGithub: https://github.com/GabauerDavid/ConnectednessApproach\nR-workbooks: https://sites.google.com/view/davidgabauer/use-rpython\nNotes: I have testet some of the source files and scripts, and it looks very nice! I finally have found a script that cointains functions and setups necesssary for forcasting matrix`s over differant time-periods. I have stored the files on my mac-PC.

There are so much interessting content, most likley written by the smartest/best people, availible for free! This happends all the time when I am searching around looking for packages, functions or methods I can use for my own project. I end up reading or studiung cases/ functions that is not actuelly what I am suposed to do… The only downside about R, is that you probebrly are going to burn out much of your planned work hours. So stay orginzed, but also; take some time enjoying what`s out there!! I am feeling blessed, really.\nBLOG-ROLL\nThe R Trader\nlink: https://www.thertrader.com/\nr-bloggers\nlink: https://www.r-bloggers.com/\ndatacamp.\nlink: https://learn.datacamp.com/\nGenerelle Notes\nIn this section I indtend writing down my own personal “studing” notes, and make space for chapters/parts for themes I find interessting writing notes aboout. These notes are written during a typical working sesh, or just another day I find it interessting searcing around the AMAZING community for datasience resoruces!\nMy notes could be anything within the category of datasience, modelling, finance and escpacially R. I want to gather my notes in one place(folder), in the hope of possible utizlizing a connection I suspect may excist between themes I learn about during my work sessions. Said in another way; You may find random themes and paragraphs here.\nFile types, how to store them and key differences\nIt dosent matter what kind of analyst you are trust me. R, Python, Java, C, C++, S or wathever; file-types and folderstructure is key if you want to master, or just even use code and programming-languages efficient. As a result of that, I indtend storing my own personal notes from studiong/resarching about filetypes I have often met when I have coded/worked on my own personal prosjects.\nI have felt both the frustration and the irritation of not understanding/taking enough time understanding what Its really all about. As a matter of fact, If you dont understand how the algoritm likes he`s food served.. you actuelly deserve beeing tortured by error messages. At least coused from not handling your files proper. It may sound wierd, but it could exist a kind of relashionship between algortims and humans in the sens of treting whats deare in the proper way. File and data is the maintance for the script!!!\nBelow I write down extention-names on filetypes I recollect on the go. If the [] box is emtpty, it means I have not started researching properly yet.\n\nCSV[x] XLS[x] zip[] gz[] tsv[] txt[]\n\nCSV -> stores the data as text. Can only store the values, not formatting and formulas etc. \nXLS -> stores data binary file. Readable for the computer. Can store values, formatting……\nMATERIAL FEEDER\nHere I will “feed” the block with links, notes, refs and material I explore. These need to be placed in the right sections. This part is then not included in the official “document” and will be removed when there`s eventuelly no more links to feed. I have placed this feed-block on the top of the document so I can easily see it, and start sortering when i begin a work section.\nfile:///C:/Users/lyder/Desktop/Bibliography-/Notes/bookmarks_7_15_21.html\nORGANISER DETTE!\n## Linker\nhttps://libraries.io/cran/RefManageR\n\nhttps://books.ropensci.org/drake/index.html\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU1Zv21GvT4&t=4055s\n\nhttps://www.rstudio.com/resources/rstudioglobal-2021/maintaining-the-house-the-tidyverse-built/\n  \nhttps://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html#image\n\nhttps://books.ropensci.org/drake/index.html\n\n  \n  \n## PDF\nR-litteratur: mappe skrivebordet!!\n\nHar også sett på apperence_themes: shiny. \n\nIntro (START)\nThis document contains notes, links, referances and matarial I have used throughout the prosses.\n\n\n\n\nRefs to my own work stored some_where\nOutput github “test” https://github.com/lyder7/thesis-rasp/blob/master/r-markdown/test-html/test.md\nDenne har bilder, og formattering slik som html versjonen hadde.
