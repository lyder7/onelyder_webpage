      "contents": "\nMy Professional competence are mainly within academic finance- and economy literature and theory, but I have based upon this knowledge, build serious experience, competence and knowledge within the field of Data Science. I personally believe combining these two disciplines are very natural and field that belong- and share many common elements.\nI use daily code and various programming languages solving mainly analytically problems or/and project assignments. Some of the langues i commonly use are: R & Python. (R = Preferred Language).\nBased on the code-syntax knowledge I also master text- and document formatting languages/tools such as Rmarkdown, Latex, Pandoc, HTML and Markdown. Any type of output-format for the final-project report are within my “competence tool-box”, and I really understand the importance of generating the optimal- and a professional looking report.\nI use GitHub (terminal git bash) for project admin and version control. Folder structure and working directory are elements I think are essential. I can deliver the same quality and results working on a Windows computer or a Mac. I know how to optimize the workflow on both operating systems.\nPlease contact me if you want to see any former work and material I have been a part of from my personal portfolio. I would be happy to share it with you and get valuable feedback and perspectives.\n\n\n\n",
