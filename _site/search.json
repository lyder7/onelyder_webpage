Jeg styrer alt innholdet som blir publisert her, og må ikke forveksels med andre engasjement og forpliktelser jeg har. Denne siden er ment til å være et sted hvor jeg deler innsikt og output/resultater fra prosjekter jeg driver med.\nProfessional Background: My Professional competence are mainly within the academic finance- and economy literature and science. Based upon this knowledge, I have build serious experience, competence and knowledge within the field of Data Science. I personally believe combining these two disciplines are very natural believe they share key common elements.\nI daily use code and various programming languages solving mainly analytically problems or/and project-assignments. Some of the langues i commonly use are: R & Python. (R = Preferred Language).\nEducation Background: Based on the code-syntax knowledge I also master text- and document formatting languages/tools such as Rmarkdown, Latex, Pandoc, HTML and Markdown. Any type of output-format for the final-project report are within my “competence tool-box”, and I really understand the importance of generating the optimal- and a professional looking report.\nI use GitHub (terminal git bash) for project admin and version control. Folder structure and working directory are elements I think are essential. I can deliver the same quality and results working on a Windows computer or a Mac. I know how to optimize the workflow on both operating systems.\nResearch & Personal Interests: Please contact me if you want to see any former work and material I have been a part of from my personal portfolio. I would be happy to share it with you and get valuable feedback and perspectives.\n\n\n\n",
