Indeed, R supplies an entire manual describing the process of data import/export. And, despite all of that text, most of the packages described are (to varying degrees) out-of-date. Faster, simpler, packages with fewer dependencies have been created for many of the file types described in that document. rio aims to unify data I/O (importing and exporting) into two simple functions: import() and export() so that beginners (and experienced R users) never have to think twice (or even once) about the best way to read and write R data.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on portfolio construction. In particular, we present details of the classical mean--variance approach, including principles, algorithms, and examples of a long only and a market neutral long-short portfolio. We also discuss backtesting and portfolio performance attribution. We introduce Harry Markowitz who made important contributions to modern portfolio theory. Regarding industry insights, we show how industry practitioners build MV portfolios with practical constraints. For R programming, we discuss the structure of R codes and functions.},
